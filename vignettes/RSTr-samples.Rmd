## Overview

After initializing the model with `initialize_model()`, you can gather and load samples using the `run_sampler()` and `load_samples()` functions. Finally, using some basic plotting, we can look at our results and make sure they make sense.

## The `run_sampler()` function

`run_sampler()` takes in four arguments: `name`, `dir`, `.show_plots`, and `.discard_burnin`. `name` and `dir` are associated wtih the name of the folder that contains the model content and the directory where that folder lives, respectively. `.show_plots` allows you to hide the traceplots generated while the model runs and `.discard_burnin` prevents samples from being saved before the 2000-iteration burn-in period in case the dataset is particularly large. The information needed to generate the model is already saved in `name`, and so `run_sampler()` pulls this information in to generate parameter samples. When running `run_sampler()`, the R console will generate outputs describing the batch number, the total iteration number, and the time when the last batch started. By default, `run_sampler()` will generate 6000 samples, but other values can be specified as desired, rounded down to the nearest 100. For example, we can begin a simple model and generate samples:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(RSTr)

initialize_model(name = "my_test_model", data = miheart, adjacency = miadj)
run_sampler("my_test_model")
```

## The `load_samples()` function

Once `run_sampler()` tells you that the model is finished running, you can import samples into R using `load_samples()`. `load_samples()` takes in four arguments:

-   `name`: Name of the model;

-   `dir`: Directory of the model. Saves to R's temporary directory by default;

-   `param`: The parameter to import samples for. By default, imports `theta`. Values for `theta` and `beta` are expit- or exp-transformed, depending on the `method` chosen in `initialize_model()`; and

-   `burn`: Specifies a burn-in period for samples. This allows the model time to stabilize before using samples to generate estimates. By default, has a burn-in period of 2000 samples. Because of the way that `load_samples()` utilizes `burn`, it is safest to choose a burn-in period that is a multiple of 500.

Any `dimnames` that were saved to `data` will be applied to the samples as appropriate. Here, we pull in the `theta` samples for our test Michigan dataset with a 2000-sample burn-in period (as specified by the default arguments). We also multiply by 100,000 as it is common to display mortality rates per 100,000 individuals:

```{r eval = FALSE}
theta <- load_samples("my_test_model") * 1e5
```

```{r include = FALSE}
library(RSTr)

theta <- readRDS("RSTr-samples/theta.RDS")
```

### Age-standardization

But what if we want to age-standardize our samples? In our Michigan dataset, we have six 10-year age groups started at age 35 years. Perhaps we can age-standardize these into a new 35-64 group. Since we are using data from 1979-1988, we can use 1980 standard populations from [NIH](https://seer.cancer.gov/stdpopulations/stdpop.19ages.html) to generate our `std_pop` vector:

```{r}
age <- c("35-44", "45-54", "55-64")
std_pop <- c(113154, 100640, 95799)
names(std_pop) <- age
```

With `std_pop` generated, we need to then check which margin contains our age group information using the `dim()` function:

```{r}
dim(theta)
```

Our `theta` array has four margins with dimensions `83`, `6`, `10`, and `400`, representing the spatial regions, age groups, time periods, and samples, respectively. Let's set a variable `margin_age` to represent our age group margin and standardize our `theta` estimates using the `age_standardize()` function:

```{r}
margin_age <- 2
theta_3564 <- age_standardize(theta[, 1:3, , ], std_pop, margin_age)
```

We subset `theta` to only the columns containing our age groups of interest: `35-44`, `45-54`, and `55-64` (i,e,. columns 1-3).

Now, we have a standalone array for our age-standardized 35-64 age group. Let's consolidate this into our main `theta` array using the `bind_samples()` function:

```{r}
theta <- bind_samples(
  sample = theta,
  agg_sample = theta_3564,
  margin = margin_age,
  new_name = "35-64"
)
```

Now, our last samples and our age-standardized samples live in the same array. In case we are trying to do aggregation *without* standardization, such as weighted averages among non-age groups, it is important to also pull in the population array as the weight and to calculate population information along any consolidated or standardized groups. If the population data isn't readily available, it can be pulled from the model folder using the `load_pop()` function, then prepared for use with `theta` using `aggregate_pop()` and `bind_samples()`:

```{r include = FALSE}
pop <- miheart$n
pop <- bind_samples(
  sample = pop,
  agg_sample = aggregate_pop(pop[, 1:3, ], margin_age),
  margin = margin_age,
  new_name = "35-64"
)
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
pop <- load_pop("my_test_model")
pop <- bind_samples(
  sample = pop,
  agg_sample = aggregate_pop(pop[, 1:3, ], margin_age),
  margin = margin_age,
  new_name = "35-64"
)
```

So now, what if we want to get estimates averaged across all years? In this case, we will expand our `theta` and `pop` arrays using the `aggregate_group()` and `aggregate_pop()` functions, respectively:

```{r}
margin_year <- 3
theta <- bind_samples(
  theta,
  aggregate_group(theta, pop, margin_year),
  margin_year,
  "1979-1988"
)
pop <- bind_samples(
  pop,
  aggregate_pop(pop, margin_year),
  margin_year,
  "1979-1988"
)
```

Now, our samples for `theta` are aggregated by year and age-standardized and we have matching array values for `pop`. Note that if you plan on doing a mix of non-age aggregation and age-standardization, do age-standardization after all aggregation, as the doing age-standardization first will alter the results of any aggregation done afterward.

Note that the process of age- and group-standardization is identical for both MSTCAR and MCAR models, and that age/group-standardization is not possible for UCAR models.

### Traceplots

Before we generate our median estimates for our samples, let's quickly check some high- and low-population counties to see the stability of the samples:

```{r}
counties <- c(
  which.max(miheart$n[, "55-64", "1979"]),
  which.min(miheart$n[, "55-64", "1979"])
)
x <- dimnames(theta)[[4]]
yhigh <- theta[counties[1], "35-64", "1979", ]
ylow <- theta[counties[2], "35-64", "1979", ]
raw_high <- sum(miheart$Y[counties[1], 1:3, "1979"]) /
  sum(miheart$n[counties[1], 1:3, "1979"]) *
  1e5
raw_low <- sum(miheart$Y[counties[2], 1:3, "1979"]) /
  sum(miheart$n[counties[2], 1:3, "1979"]) *
  1e5
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(
  x,
  yhigh,
  type = "l",
  main = paste0("Smoothed rates, 1979, 35-64, FIPS ", names(counties[1]))
)
abline(h = raw_high, col = "red")
plot(
  x,
  ylow,
  type = "l",
  main = paste0("Smoothed rates, 1979, 35-64, FIPS ", names(counties[2]))
)
abline(h = raw_low, col = "red")
```

This code generates two traceplots representing our sample values over time for a given county-group-year. On the left, we can see a traceplot for the highest-population county, and on the right is a traceplot for the lowest-population county. Each traceplot also includes a red line representing the mean event rate for that county-group-year. Note that in both traceplots, the mean line is nearby the plots, but higher, indicating that the rates in both of these counties were attenuated thanks to spatial smoothing.

The traceplot on the left is exactly what we want to see: it is clearly fluctuating around a certain value and will give us reliable estimates for that county. The right traceplot, however, is a bit less favorable: the value doesn't seem to want to stabilize and jumps between values over the course of the model. However, the rate itself is naturally high, so the intensity of the fluctuation isn't shocking. Smaller counties like the one shown here demonstrate the limits of `RSTr`: while the samples do hover around a single value for some iterations, the estimated values we would get for the county-group-year on the right will not be as reliable as estimates on the left due to the large variability of the samples gathered. To learn more about reliability measures, read `vignette("RSTr-medians")`.

## Closing Thoughts

In this vignette, we discussed generating samples with `run_sampler()`, importing those samples into R and age-standardization using `load_samples()`, and generating traceplots to get a gut-check on our dataset and the implications of sporadic traceplots.
